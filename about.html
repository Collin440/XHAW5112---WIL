        <p>
          <strong>Empowering the Nation</strong> was founded by <strong>Precious Radebe</strong> with a mission to provide practical skills training to domestic workers and gardeners in South Africa. Our goal is to uplift individuals by equipping them with real-world abilities that open doors to employment and personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer two main types of programs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>6-Month Courses (First Aid, Life Skills, Landscaping, Sewing)</li>
          <li>6-Week Short Skills Courses (Child Minding, Cooking, Garden Maintenance)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All our courses are designed with hands-on learning, guided mentorship, and community support.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in the power of education to break cycles of poverty and empower people to create better futures for themselves and their families.
